    "# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "In this project,  I will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia to understand the following questions:\n",
    "* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers."
